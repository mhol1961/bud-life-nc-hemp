# Dev Branch Push Instructions

## 🔥 URGENT: Authentication Issue Resolution Required

### Current Status
- ✅ Dev branch created and committed locally
- ✅ All enhanced e-commerce features included
- ❌ GitHub push blocked by token permissions

### Quick Fix Commands

#### 1. Update GitHub Token
Generate new token with `repo` scope at:
https://github.com/settings/tokens

#### 2. Execute Push
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd beautiful-admin-portal

# Set remote with new token
git remote set-url origin https://NEW_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/mhol1961/bud-life-nc-hemp.git

# Push to dev branch
git push origin dev
```

#### 3. Verify Success
```bash
# Check remote branches
git ls-remote --heads origin

# Should show:
# refs/heads/dev
# refs/heads/main
```

### Alternative: Use Bundle File
If token issues persist, use the created bundle:
```bash
git bundle verify dev-branch-bundle.bundle
git fetch dev-branch-bundle.bundle dev:dev
git push origin dev
```
